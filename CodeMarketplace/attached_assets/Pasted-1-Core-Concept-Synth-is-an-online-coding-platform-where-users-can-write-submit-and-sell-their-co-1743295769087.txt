1. Core Concept

Synth is an online coding platform where users can write, submit, and sell their code. It focuses on community-driven coding, allowing developers to collaborate and monetize their work.
2. Website Layout & Pages

    Home Page

        Modern, minimalistic design with a dark or neutral theme.

        A hero section introducing Synth with a call-to-action (e.g., "Start Coding Now").

        A showcase of trending or recently uploaded code snippets.

        Testimonials or community engagement stats (e.g., "5,000+ developers coding on Synth").

    Code Editor Page

        A full-screen, lightweight code editor (like CodePen).

        Supports multiple languages (starting with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, etc.).

        Features:

            Syntax highlighting

            Auto-save drafts

            Run & preview option (for front-end code)

            A ‘Save & Publish’ button that uploads the code for sale.

    Marketplace Page

        Lists all available code snippets for purchase.

        Filtering and sorting options (e.g., by language, price, popularity).

        Each listing shows:

            Code title

            Short description

            Price (default: $2.99 AUD)

            A preview or demo (if applicable)

            Purchase button.

    User Dashboard

        Displays submitted code, sales analytics, and earnings.

        Purchase history for buyers.

        Account settings (payment, profile, notifications).

    Community Page

        A space for discussions, collaboration, and featured projects.

        Possibly a voting system for the best submissions.

3. Key Monetization System

    When a user submits code, it becomes available for $2.99 AUD.

    After 3 days, the "Save & Publish" button automatically converts the submission into a downloadable file.

    Users can purchase and download code snippets, generating revenue for Synth.

4. Technical Aspects

    Front-End: Likely built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React for dynamic UI).

    Back-End: Python or Node.js to handle file processing, user authentication, and payment integration.

    Database: A system to store user data, submitted code, and transaction history.

    Payment Integration: Stripe or PayPal for handling purchases.
